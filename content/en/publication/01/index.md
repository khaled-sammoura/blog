## Introduction  

Modern software development requires both high delivery speed and reliability. The **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) approach addresses these needs by automating the processes of building, testing, and deploying software products.  

## Key Concepts  

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** — the practice of frequently merging developers’ code into the main branch with automated testing and validation.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** — automation of preparing the application for deployment, including testing, artifact building, and validation.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** — an automated process of delivering changes into the production environment once all checks are successfully passed.  

## Advantages of CI/CD  

- Reduction of errors through automated testing.  
- Decreased time between writing code and its use by end users.  
- Improved product quality through rapid feedback.  
- Streamlined collaboration within the development team.  

## CI/CD Tools  

Some of the most widely used tools include:  

- **GitHub Actions** — integrated into the GitHub ecosystem to automate workflows.  
- **GitLab CI/CD** — built-in automation features within GitLab.  
- **Jenkins** — one of the earliest and most flexible tools for CI/CD orchestration.  
- **CircleCI** and **Travis CI** — cloud-based solutions for build and test automation.  

## Conclusion  

CI/CD has become a standard in modern software development. Its implementation allows teams to adapt more quickly to changing requirements and deliver higher-quality products.  

In the future, the development of CI/CD is expected to integrate machine learning methods for test optimization, error prediction, and system resilience enhancement.
